# day-of-the-week

This is a algorithm which is based of a sanskrit text to calculate the day of the week with very high accuracy
This algoithm can provide the day for any date until the year 2100.
## Limitations

Because of the implementation of leap year in Gregorian 2100 is not considered a leap year thus, the algorithm fails exactly of the first day of March in 2100.
